A tool for comparing two files containing LHCb data.

When making changes to LHCb's reconstruction software
you have to make sure the results change in a way that
you udnerstand. This tool will compute certain things
for every event in two files and tell you if they
are different. This is useful when you have one
file from the old version of the reconstruction
software and a file with your changes.

Merckx be with you if you introduce changes!
